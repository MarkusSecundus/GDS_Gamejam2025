Tiny top-down dungeon crawler made for [GDS Gamejam 2025](https://markussecundus.itch.io/staff-of-madness).

Solo project. All code and graphics assets were created by myself. Music was stolen with minor tweaks from a [gamejam game i did last year](https://github.com/TomasTatra/GameJam2024) (which is public under MIT and free to use for anyone).
